TODO

- Split screen system (centered on 2 entities)
- Objects management from Tiled : entity (enemy mob, object?), marker(player spawn position, item spawn?)
- Kinematic Object!
- Fixed collision ambiguity! (falling from a ladder, the player can't collide with ladder tile)
- Improve sprite loading (should be just one image)
- Input configuration Menu (FIFA style)
- Choose font
- Added title screen intro
