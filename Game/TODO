TODO

* Split screen system (centered on 2 entities)
- entity hierarchy!!!!! (update coordinate)
- entity attachement
- Character inventory
- rename action to update (seperate from state handling)

* Improve sprite loading (should be just one image)
- Input configuration Menu (FIFA style)
- Choose font
- Added title screen intro
- refactor camera code
